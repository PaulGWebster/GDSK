	@
	@ Trivia.
	@
	@ Result of multiplication of n-bit number by m-bit number is
	@ n+m bits wide. However! Even though 2^n is a n+1-bit number,
	@ m-bit number multiplied by 2^n is still n+m bits wide.
	@
	@ Sum of two n-bit numbers is n+1 bits wide, sum of three - n+2,
	@ and so is sum of four. Sum of 2^m n-m-bit numbers and n-bit
	@ one is n+1 bits wide.
	@
	@ >>+ denotes Hnext += Hn>>26, Hn &= 0x3ffffff. This means that
	@ H0, H2, H3 are guaranteed to be 26 bits wide, while H1 and H4
	@ can be 27. However! In cases when their width exceeds 26 bits
	@ they are limited by 2^26+2^6. This in turn means that *sum*
	@ of the products with these values can still be viewed as sum
	@ of 52-bit numbers as long as the amount of addends is not a
	@ power of 2. For example,
	@
	@ H4 = H4*R0 + H3*R1 + H2*R2 + H1*R3 + H0 * R4,
	@
	@ which can't be larger than 5 * (2^26 + 2^6) * (2^26 + 2^6), or
	@ 5 * (2^52 + 2*2^32 + 2^12), which in turn is smaller than
	@ 8 * (2^52) or 2^55. However, the value is then multiplied by
	@ by 5, so we should be looking at 5 * 5 * (2^52 + 2^33 + 2^12),
	@ which is less than 32 * (2^52) or 2^57. And when processing
	@ data we are looking at triple as many addends...
	@
	@ In key setup procedure pre-reduced H0 is limited by 5*4+1 and
	@ 5*H4 - by 5*5 52-bit addends, or 57 bits. But when hashing the
	@ input H0 is limited by (5*4+1)*3 addends, or 58 bits, while
	@ 5*H4 by 5*5*3, or 59[!] bits. How is this relevant? vmlal.u32
	@ instruction accepts 2x32-bit input and writes 2x64-bit result.
	@ This means that result of reduction have to be compressed upon
	@ loop wrap-around. This can be done in the process of reduction
	@ to minimize amount of instructions [as well as amount of
	@ 128-bit instructions, which benefits low-end processors], but
	@ one has to watch for H2 (which is narrower than H0) and 5*H4
	@ not being wider than 58 bits, so that result of right shift
	@ by 26 bits fits in 32 bits. This is also useful on x86,
	@ because it allows to use paddd in place for paddq, which
	@ benefits Atom, where paddq is ridiculously slow.

@ SHA256 block procedure for ARMv4. May 2007.

@ Performance is ~2x better than gcc 3.4 generated code and in "abso-
@ lute" terms is ~2250 cycles per 64-byte block or ~35 cycles per
@ byte [on single-issue Xscale PXA250 core].

@ July 2010.
@
@ Rescheduling for dual-issue pipeline resulted in 22% improvement on
@ Cortex A8 core and ~20 cycles per processed byte.

@ February 2011.
@
@ Profiler-assisted and platform-specific optimization resulted in 16%
@ improvement on Cortex A8 core and ~15.4 cycles per processed byte.

@ September 2013.
@
@ Add NEON implementation. On Cortex A8 it was measured to process one
@ byte in 12.5 cycles or 23% faster than integer-only code. Snapdragon
@ S4 does it in 12.5 cycles too, but it's 50% faster than integer-only
@ code (meaning that latter performs sub-optimally, nothing was done
@ about it).

@ May 2014.
@
@ Add ARMv8 code path performing at 2.0 cpb on Apple A7.

@ $output is the last argument if it looks like a file (it has an extension)
@ $flavour is the first argument if it doesn't look like a file

@ SHA512 block procedure for ARMv4. September 2007.

@ This code is ~4.5 (four and a half) times faster than code generated
@ by gcc 3.4 and it spends ~72 clock cycles per byte [on single-issue
@ Xscale PXA250 core].
@
@ July 2010.
@
@ Rescheduling for dual-issue pipeline resulted in 6% improvement on
@ Cortex A8 core and ~40 cycles per processed byte.

@ February 2011.
@
@ Profiler-assisted and platform-specific optimization resulted in 7%
@ improvement on Coxtex A8 core and ~38 cycles per byte.

@ March 2011.
@
@ Add NEON implementation. On Cortex A8 it was measured to process
@ one byte in 23.3 cycles or ~60% faster than integer-only code.

@ August 2012.
@
@ Improve NEON performance by 12% on Snapdragon S4. In absolute
@ terms it's 22.6 cycles per byte, which is disappointing result.
@ Technical writers asserted that 3-way S4 pipeline can sustain
@ multiple NEON instructions per cycle, but dual NEON issue could
@ not be observed, see http://www.openssl.org/~appro/Snapdragon-S4.html
@ for further details. On side note Cortex-A15 processes one byte in
@ 16 cycles.

@ Byte order [in]dependence. =========================================
@
@ Originally caller was expected to maintain specific *dword* order in
@ h[0-7], namely with most significant dword at *lower* address, which
@ was reflected in below two parameters as 0 and 4. Now caller is
@ expected to maintain native byte order for whole 64-bit values.

/*-
 * The following macros and typedefs allow an ASN1_ITEM
 * to be embedded in a structure and referenced. Since
 * the ASN1_ITEM pointers need to be globally accessible
 * (possibly from shared libraries) they may exist in
 * different forms. On platforms that support it the
 * ASN1_ITEM structure itself will be globally exported.
 * Other platforms will export a function that returns
 * an ASN1_ITEM pointer.
 *
 * To handle both cases transparently the macros below
 * should be used instead of hard coding an ASN1_ITEM
 * pointer in a structure.
 *
 * The structure will look like this:
 *
 * typedef struct SOMETHING_st {
 *      ...
 *      ASN1_ITEM_EXP *iptr;
 *      ...
 * } SOMETHING;
 *
 * It would be initialised as e.g.:
 *
 * SOMETHING somevar = {...,ASN1_ITEM_ref(X509),...};
 *
 * and the actual pointer extracted with:
 *
 * const ASN1_ITEM *it = ASN1_ITEM_ptr(somevar.iptr);
 *
 * Finally an ASN1_ITEM pointer can be extracted from an
 * appropriate reference with: ASN1_ITEM_rptr(X509). This
 * would be used when a function takes an ASN1_ITEM * argument.
 *

 *
 * For PRIMITIVE types the underlying type
 * determines the behaviour if items is NULL.
 *
 * Otherwise templates must contain a single
 * template and the type is treated in the
 * same way as the type specified in the template.
 *
 * For SEQUENCE types the templates field points
 * to the members, the size field is the
 * structure size.
 *
 * For CHOICE types the templates field points
 * to each possible member (typically a union)
 * and the 'size' field is the offset of the
 * selector.
 *
 * The 'funcs' field is used for application-specific
 * data and functions.
 *
 * The EXTERN type uses a new style d2i/i2d.
 * The new style should be used where possible
 * because it avoids things like the d2i IMPLICIT
 * hack.
 *
 * MSTRING is a multiple string type, it is used
 * for a CHOICE of character strings where the
 * actual strings all occupy an ASN1_STRING
 * structure. In this case the 'utype' field
 * has a special meaning, it is used as a mask
 * of acceptable types using the B_ASN1 constants.
 *
 * NDEF_SEQUENCE is the same as SEQUENCE except
 * that it will use indefinite length constructed
 * encoding if requested.

/*-
 * The error code packs differently depending on if it records a system
 * error or an OpenSSL error.
 *
 * A system error packs like this (we follow POSIX and only allow positive
 * numbers that fit in an |int|):
 *
 * +-+-------------------------------------------------------------+
 * |1|                     system error number                     |
 * +-+-------------------------------------------------------------+
 *
 * An OpenSSL error packs like this:
 *
 * <---------------------------- 32 bits -------------------------->
 *    <--- 8 bits ---><------------------ 23 bits ----------------->
 * +-+---------------+---------------------------------------------+
 * |0|    library    |                    reason                   |
 * +-+---------------+---------------------------------------------+
 *
 * A few of the reason bits are reserved as flags with special meaning:
 *
 *                    <5 bits-<>--------- 19 bits ----------------->
 *                   +-------+-+-----------------------------------+
 *                   | rflags| |          reason                   |
 *                   +-------+-+-----------------------------------+
 *                            ^
 *                            |
 *                           ERR_RFLAG_FATAL = ERR_R_FATAL
 *
 * The reason flags are part of the overall reason code for practical
 * reasons, as they provide an easy way to place different types of
 * reason codes in different numeric ranges.
 *
 * The currently known reason flags are:
 *
 * ERR_RFLAG_FATAL      Flags that the reason code is considered fatal.
 *                      For backward compatibility reasons, this flag
 *                      is also the code for ERR_R_FATAL (that reason
 *                      code served the dual purpose of flag and reason
 *                      code in one in pre-3.0 OpenSSL).
 * ERR_RFLAG_COMMON     Flags that the reason code is common to all
 *                      libraries.  All ERR_R_ macros must use this flag,
 *                      and no other _R_ macro is allowed to use it.
