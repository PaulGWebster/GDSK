Tests that the DFG knows that a function that appears like Math.max could potentially use value in arbitrary ways, and not just in a context that converts values to numbers.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Tests that the DFG knows that a function that appears like Math.min could potentially use value in arbitrary ways, and not just in a context that converts values to numbers.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

This tests that Math.min and Math.max for doubles works correctly in the DFG JIT.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Tests that a variable predicted to be either int or double but proven to be an int does confuse the Branch logic.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

This tests that a structure clobber in a basic block that does not touch a live variable causes that variable's structure to be correctly clobbered.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Tests that the peephole CompareEq optimization for the case where one side is predicted final object and the other side is predicted either final object or other (i.e. null or undefined) doesn't assert when both sides are also proven final object.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Tests that the DFG knows that a Math.sqrt could potentially use value in arbitrary ways, and not just in a context that converts values to numbers.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Tests that the DFG knows that a function that appears like Math.sqrt could potentially use value in arbitrary ways, and not just in a context that converts values to numbers.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS foo(Math.sqrt, [1.5], 0) is Math.sqrt(1.5)
PASS foo(Math.sqrt, [1.5], 0) is Math.sqrt(1.5)

Tests what happens when you store an unexpected value into an argument (where the original argument value was the expected one) and then OSR exit.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Tests what happens when you do ToString twice, and it has a side effect that clobbers the toString method in between the two ToStrings.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

This tests that if the DFG fails to convert a uint32 to a number, it will OSR exit correctly.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

Tests that UInt32ToNumber and OSR exit are aware of copy propagation and correctly recover both versions of a variable that was subject to a UInt32ToNumber cast.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
